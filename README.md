## ABOUT
Welcome to the Cherry Leaf Mildew Detection Dashboard, an innovative solution developed to tackle a pressing issue in agricultural disease management. This project, led by Marianne McGuineys, is designed to harness the power of machine learning to streamline the detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy in crop health monitoring.

The primary objective of this project is to automate the detection of powdery mildew—a common and damaging fungal disease affecting cherry trees. Traditionally, the process of identifying and treating this disease has been manual and labor-intensive, requiring significant time and resources. This dashboard revolutionizes this approach by providing a fast, reliable, and scalable method to identify powdery mildew using image analysis.

## UX
The Cherry Leaf Mildew Detection Dashboard is designed to offer a straightforward and effective user experience, making advanced machine learning accessible even to those without technical backgrounds. Simplicity and functionality are at the heart of its design.

* Navigating the dashboard is effortless. The clean and minimalistic interface ensures that users can quickly focus on what matters most—analyzing their cherry leaf images. Upon accessing the dashboard, users are greeted with a clear prompt to upload an image of a cherry leaf. The intuitive drag-and-drop feature or the traditional file upload button make it easy for users to submit their images.

* Once an image is uploaded, the system immediately processes it and displays the results. Within seconds, users receive a clear classification indicating whether the leaf is 'Healthy' or has 'Powdery Mildew', along with a confidence score. This instant feedback is crucial for timely decision-making in agricultural practices.

* The dashboard avoids technical jargon and complex settings. There are no confusing options or unnecessary steps. Users simply upload an image, and the dashboard does the rest. This focus on simplicity ensures that users can concentrate on managing their crops without being overwhelmed by the technology.

* Visual clarity is a key aspect of the dashboard's effectiveness. The uploaded image is prominently displayed, allowing users to see exactly what is being analyzed. The results are presented in a bold and straightforward manner, making it easy to understand the condition of the leaf at a glance.
