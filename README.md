## ABOUT
Welcome to the Cherry Leaf Mildew Detection Dashboard, an innovative solution developed to tackle a pressing issue in agricultural disease management. This project, led by Marianne McGuineys, is designed to harness the power of machine learning to streamline the detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy in crop health monitoring.

The primary objective of this project is to automate the detection of powdery mildewâ€”a common and damaging fungal disease affecting cherry trees. Traditionally, the process of identifying and treating this disease has been manual and labor-intensive, requiring significant time and resources. This dashboard revolutionizes this approach by providing a fast, reliable, and scalable method to identify powdery mildew using image analysis.
